    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src=""> <img src="img_1092.jpg" width ="200" height = "300">
    <p>My name is Seth McNabb. I'm from Henderson Nevada and served a mission in the Philippines. 
        I've been married for almost 2 years and have a 4 month old who keeps our hands super full. </p>
    <p2>I am interested in web development and might be purusing a bachelors degree in it and am 
        super excited to take this class. I love making things for others to use, so far this has 
        just included making resource materials for my team at work, but I hope what I learn in this 
        class can help me extend my ability to do that.  </p2> <p3>One thing that has drawn me to 
        this field is seeing the job lisings my current company posts, they seem more exciting and 
        rewarding than what I am currently doing.</p3> <p4>I'm a lifelong member of the church and 
        am super grateful for all the knowledge and hope it provides.</p4>
